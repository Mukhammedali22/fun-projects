ðŸŽ® Fun Projects Collection


Welcome to **Fun Projects** â€” a small collection of creative visual experiments written in JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.  
Each mini-project explores simple but engaging ideas in animation and cellular automata.

## Falling Snow Animation (Saga on Vinland)

A relaxing snowfall animation inspired by *Vinland Saga*.  
Each snowflake moves according to a smooth mathematical function that combines several sine waves, creating a gentle oscillation as it falls.
When a flake reaches the bottom of the screen, it reappears at the top, creating a continuous snowfall effect.

## Game of Life

**Conwayâ€™s Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician **John Conway**.  
Each cell on the grid can be either *alive* or *dead*, and evolves through discrete steps based on its neighbors.

**Rules:**
- A living cell dies if it has fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors.  
- A dead cell becomes alive if it has exactly 3 neighbors.  
- In all other cases, the cellâ€™s state remains the same.

Two implementations are included:

1. **Basic version** (lifegame.py) â€“ simple simulation of Conwayâ€™s logic.  
2. **Enhanced version** (lifegame2.py) â€“ supports:
   - start/pause (`Enter`, `P`);
   - draw and erase cells with the mouse;
   - restart (`R`);
   - dynamic FPS (fast editing, slow simulation);
   - exit/close the program ('X")
